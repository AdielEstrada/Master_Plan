# Master Plan

## Description
A Master Plan was created with a fictional project in mind. We were proposed to build a recreational center, event venue or anything that would help revitalize Douglas.

This was the lot assigned to us. We had to use it to make a recreational center. I chose to build an event venue, since I figured I could use the experience to learn about similar buildings in the future.
