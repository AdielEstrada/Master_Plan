# Master Plan

## Description
A Master Plan was created with a fictional project in mind. We were proposed to build a recreational center, event venue or anything that would help revitalize Douglas.

This was the lot assigned to us. We had to use it to make a recreational center. I chose to build an event venue, since I figured I could use the experience to learn about similar buildings in the future.

## AutoCAD Finalized Master Plan

After we designed the Master Plan on paper, we translated that on to AutoCAD. The drawing on paper was done to scale, so that we could plan out the building, the size of the parking lot, and also, so that we could see how to integrate greenery into our buildings.
